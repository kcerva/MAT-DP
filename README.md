# MAT-DP
## (Material Demand Projections)

Welcome to the MAT-dp repo, which aims to study the material implications of energy and transport systems 

## Usage

This repo contains information on the materials required for building different types of power plants, the emissions associated to each, their water use, their costs and the employmen that each power plant can represent. The calculation in the MAT-dp notebook/script are to take those values on materials and their implications and scale them based on electricity output projections made for different countries.

The model has already been applied to 47 African countries as part of the Climate Compatible Growth programme, but many more can be studied with this model.
